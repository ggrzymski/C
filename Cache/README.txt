Designed a simulation of a 3-level strictly inclusive cache (L1, L2, and L3).

Users were given options for:

	1. Cache and block sizes.

	2. Associativity(direct-mapped, fully associative, n-way 	associative).

	3. Replacement algorithm (LRU, FIFO).

Published final report after each process run. Details included: # of memory accesses, cache hits, and cache misses for each level.
